# Background on Dataset

## General information and Data Collection
The Transit-Only Lane Enforcement (TOLE) is run by the San Fransico Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) from March 2008 to February 2015 as a pilot program to reduce obstruction of transit-only lanes through increased enforcement. Currently, private and commerical vehicles that drive and park in transit-only lanes can cause delays in bus service, increase traffic jams, and inconveniencing customers.

Under the TOLE program, all public buses are equipped with video cameras to capture the license plates of vehicles parked or stopped in a dedicated transit-lane. The vehicle's registered owner will then recieve the ciation in the mail in aims to deter future transit-only lane violations. These citations and their details form the dataset we are examining.The data were obtained from the US government's open data site at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/muni-driver-reported-transit-only-lane-violations. 

San Fransico currently operates 26 miles transit-only lanes with 160,000 daily passsengers and planned future expansion of 22 miles, so the TOLE program has strong potential for long-term impact by increasing the efficiency of the municipal transity system and potentially increasing municipal revenue temporarily as drivers adjust to the enforcement scheme.
